    "This practical session is forked from Dr Tom Maullin's [Nilearn practical repository](https://github.com/TomMaullin/Nilearn2023/) from 2023, with some minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Nilearn2025` folder you will find this and 2 other notebooks. Each notebook will introduce you to a different type of statistical analysis in fMRI and show you how to analyze fMRI data using the `Nilearn` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first notebook will begin by talking you through the basics of the `Nibabel` and `Nilearn` packages. After this, we will cover in detail first-level analyses. The second notebook will show you how to perform a second-level analysis and give further discussion of statistic values and thresholding your images."
